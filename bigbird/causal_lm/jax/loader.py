It is built on top of **NumPy**, providing a familiar interface for those already comfortable with it, but with added features for automatic differentiation, GPU/TPU acceleration, and more.1. **NumPy-Compatible**: JAX is designed to be a drop-in replacement for **NumPy**, meaning that the code written in NumPy can often be used directly in JAX with minimal changes.JAX functions (such as `jax.numpy`) are compatible with NumPy syntax, so if you're familiar with NumPy, the learning curve for JAX is shallow.2. **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**: One of the core features of JAX is its ability to compute **gradients** (derivatives) of functions.The `jax.grad` function allows for automatic differentiation of scalar or vector-valued functions. This is useful in optimization, machine learning, and physics simulations.
        JAX can compute gradients for functions written in a **Pythonic** way, without requiring manual derivative computation, making it much more efficient for machine learning and other scientific applications.JAX uses **XLA**, which stands for **Accelerated Linear Algebra**, to perform optimized computation on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.With XLA, JAX can execute code much faster by optimizing the computation graph (just-in-time (JIT) compilation) and running it efficiently on hardware accelerators.**Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation** in JAX refers to the process of converting Python code into highly optimized machine code that runs faster. This is achieved through the `jax.jit` decorator, which compiles a function once and reuses the compiled version, speeding up the execution.The result is a substantial boost in performance, especially for large-scale machine learning models or iterative algorithms.JAX allows for the creation of custom gradients for user-defined operations, giving researchers and engineers flexibility
        to define their own backpropagation rules.It also offers function transformations such as `jax.jit`, `jax.grad`, `jax.vmap`, and `jax.pmap` that help with optimization, parallelization, and differentiation. **JAX** is an open-source numerical computing library developed by Google, which is primarily used for high-performance machine learning research and other scientific computing tasks.
